# 🤖💬 llms-at-uclh 🏥

Bringing together clinical and technical experts at UCL Hospital (UCLH) + UCL's Institute of Health Informatics (IHI) to **research Large Language Models on real NHS data and tasks**.

Together UCLH and the IHI have the people 👩‍⚕️👨‍💻, infrastructure 🏗, and data 📊 to become UK & global leaders in medical LLMs.

Our goal: build a community that collaborates, shares, and makes clinical LLM research happen.

## 🎯 Aims

✨ Show cutting edge stuff we have done – demos, prototypes, research.

📚 Share best practices - for developing & evaluating LLMs in a clinical context.

🤝 Bring everyone together – avoid siloed efforts, foster collaboration between clinical & technical teams.

## 🗓 What We Do

☕ Meet-ups
- Every other Wednesday 10am IHI (@ 222 Euston Rd)

📖 Docs
- End to End "How to Run an LLM study at UCLH" (work in progress)
  
💬 Slack group
- Main communication/troubleshooting venue
- Virtual Journal Club

🚀 Collaborate, Research, Publish (and implement...)
- Key collaborting orgs include

## 📂 Projects & Resources

### 🧪 How to Run an LLM study at UCLH
- Best practices on data governance, methodology, trusted research enviorment, compute, evaluation etc...
- WIP
- Main Contact: [Simon Ellershaw](simon.ellershaw.20@ucl.ac.uk)

### 📝 Discharge Summaries
Developing a system to automate discharge summaries using large language models guided by clinical guidelines. Completed a proof of concept using publicly available data, and currently conducting a retrospective study within a UCLH.

Published paper on public (MIMIC-III) data

### 🗣️ LLM Advice and Guidance
Prototype (proof‑of‑concept) pipeline for Advice & Guidance generation using a locally hosted MedGemma. The idea is to evaluate LLM outputs on real retrospective queries using UCLH's Trusted Research Environment (TRE).
